# Socket Server with Redis Pub/Sub

This repository contains a Node.js application serving as a WebSocket server that listens to a Redis Pub/Sub channel. The server emits events to connected frontend clients in real-time, providing a seamless communication channel.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Redis Server

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/socket-server-redis.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd socket-server
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
Update the configuration settings in the config.js file to match your Redis server details and other preferences.

```javascript
  const client = redis.createClient({
      url :"redis://localhost:6379"
  });
```
## Usage
Run the socket server using the following command:

```bash
npm app.js
```

The server will start listening on the specified port and connect to the Redis channel. Clients can connect to the WebSocket server to receive real-time updates.

## Frontend Integration
In your frontend application, use a WebSocket library (e.g., Socket.IO) to connect to the server and listen for events. Example code snippet:

```javascript
// Example frontend code using Socket.IO
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

socket.on('eventFromServer', (data) => {
  // Handle the received event data
  console.log('Received event:', data);
});

// Add other socket event listeners as needed
```
